### ADDITIONAL TERMS

In addition to the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL v3),
the following additional terms apply to any and all derived works, modified
versions, or redistributed versions of this software:

#### 1. Attribution and Prominence Requirements for Derived Works

   - **Author Attribution**: Every version of this software, including
     derivative works or redistributed versions, must prominently credit
     Jeffrey Getzin as the primary creator of the game. This attribution must
     appear with equal or greater prominence than it does in the original
     software and must use the specific phrasing “Game created by Jeffrey
     Getzin” or similar language that makes clear Jeffrey Getzin’s role as the
     original creator.

   - **Inspirational Credit to *Wizardry***: This game is inspired by
     *Wizardry*, a game developed by Sir-Tech Software, originally authored by
     Robert Woodhead and Andrew C. Greenberg. The credit “Inspired by
     *Wizardry* by Sir-Tech Software, developed by Robert Woodhead and
     Andrew C. Greenberg” (or equivalent language) must be displayed prominently
     in any derived work in a location of equal or greater prominence than it
     appears in the original software. This acknowledgment should be located on
     the main menu, opening credits, or an equally visible location in the
     derived software.

#### 2. Dedication to Jenny Mayer

   - **Perpetual Dedication in Source Code**: The original software includes a
     dedication to Jenny Mayer, the late grandmother of Jeffrey Getzin. This
     dedication appears in the original source code as follows:

     "This game is dedicated to the memory of my late grandmother, Jenny Mayer
     on this day, 10/13/1988."

     Any and all derivative works must reproduce this dedication verbatim. This
     exact dedication text must be retained in the source code of any derived or
     redistributed version of the software.

   - **Alternative Prominent Placement**: In addition to the source code, this
     dedication may also be included in a prominent `README` file or another
     documentation file that is highly visible to end users. However, the exact
     dedication text must remain in the source code as specified.

#### 3. Equal Prominence for All Original Credits

   - **Placement of Other Credits**: All other original credits within this
     software, including contributors, creators, and entities credited in main
     menus, splash screens, credit screens, sub-pages, source code comments, or
     documentation, must be retained in derivative works. Each credited name
     must appear in a location of equal prominence in the derived work as it
     appears in the original software.

   - **Consistency of Titles**: Each credited name must appear with the same or
     equivalent title or role (e.g., "Written by," "Graphics by," etc.) as in
     the original work.

#### 4. Requirements for Use of Dungeons & Dragons Intellectual Property

   - **Compliance with Wizards of the Coast Licensing Terms**: If this software
     or any derivative work incorporates intellectual property from *Dungeons &
     Dragons* as published by Wizards of the Coast (e.g., creatures, spells,
     rules, mechanics), the derivative work must fully comply with the
     applicable licensing terms specified by Wizards of the Coast for use of
     their intellectual property. This may include adherence to the Open Game
     License (OGL) or any other relevant licensing terms, disclaimers, or
     requirements provided by Wizards of the Coast.

   - **License Notice for Wizards of the Coast Content**: Any derivative work
     using *Dungeons & Dragons* content must include a notice stating compliance
     with Wizards of the Coast's licensing terms, along with any required
     copyright, trademark, and/or licensing disclaimers specified by Wizards of
     the Coast in the OGL or similar licensing terms. This notice should be
     placed in a prominent location, such as within the game's documentation,
     credits, or license text.

#### 5. Modification of Credits

   - **No Removal or Alteration**: Derivative authors may not alter or remove
     any of the original credits, including the author’s attribution,
     inspirational credit to *Wizardry* by Sir-Tech Software, or the dedication
     to Jenny Mayer. Additional contributors may be credited in derivative
     works, but these new credits must not diminish the prominence or position
     of the original credits.

   - **Author and Inspirational Credit Prominence**: In derivative works, the
     credits to Jeffrey Getzin as the author and *Wizardry* by Sir-Tech Software
     as inspiration must remain among the most prominent credits, and should not
     be repositioned or minimized in any way that would reduce their visibility
     or recognition.

#### 6. Compliance

   - **License Enforcement**: Failure to comply with the requirements of this
     section will constitute a violation of the license terms under GPL v3, and
     all rights granted by this license will automatically terminate as
     specified in Section 8 of GPL v3 if the terms are not met within 30 days of
     receiving notice.

By adhering to these additional terms, you acknowledge and agree to uphold the
legacy and contributions of all individuals, entities, and dedications credited
in the original software.

END OF ADDITIONAL TERMS

# GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

## 0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

## 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

## 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

-   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
    to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
-   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
    this License applicable to that copy.

## 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

-   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.
-   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.

## 4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

-   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
    covered by this License.
-   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
    license document.
-   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
-   d) Do one of the following:
    -   0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
        this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
        Corresponding Source.
    -   1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
        the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run
        time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
        computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
        version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
        Linked Version.
-   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
    otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
    of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application
    with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
    4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
    use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in
    the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
    Corresponding Source.)

## 5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

-   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
-   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

## 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that published version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you
may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
